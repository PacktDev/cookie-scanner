# Cookie Scanner

This is a simple tool using puppeteer to scan cookies from a website; the output is a JSON file with the cookies and local storage (a bit buggy).

## Usage

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm start -- --url=https://example.com --output=report.json
# Browse in the browser that opens
# Close the browser
# Check the report.json file
```
